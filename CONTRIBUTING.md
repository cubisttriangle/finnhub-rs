# Contributing to Finnhub-rs

Firstly, thanks for wanting to contribute! All contributions are welcome, whether they are large API design changes, typo fixes, you name it.

## Finding Issues to Work On

You can find issues to work on under the [issues tab](github.com/henryboisdequin/finnhub-rs/issues). I would recommend starting with issues
labeled under `help-wanted` or `good-first-issue`. You can say you are
working on an issue by commenting, "I would like to work on this" or
something along those lines to prevent more than one person working on an
issue at once.

These issues are also triaged on the [`main` project board](https://github.com/henryboisdequin/finnhub-rs/projects/1). There you will see the issues
sorted under `Bugs`, `Feature Requests`, and `Good for new Contributors`.
This makes it slightly easier to keep track on what issues are for what
purpose and to find them easily.

## Submitting a PR

Once again, all PRs are welcome! Just submit a PR and kindly summarise your
changes or, if applicable, which issue this PR fixes. For example, if I was
working on issue `#2`, this would be my PR description: `Fixes #2`.

Once again, thanks for considering to contribute to Finnhub-rs. If you
